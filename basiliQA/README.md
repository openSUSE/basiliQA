What is basiliQA?
=================

basiliQA is a component testing framework. It lets individual software
components be tested in the cloud, in local VMs, or on test lab machines.
It enables multi-node testing, private networks, and disks on demand.

basiliQA is open source software under GNU General Public License version 2.0.

This is the __basiliQA__ package. It is the part needed to assist the test
suites during their execution. The engine itself is packaged separately.
