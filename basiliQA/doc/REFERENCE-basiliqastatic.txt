                         basiliqa-static.sh REFERENCE
                         ============================


About this reference manual
---------------------------

This is the reference of the "basiliqa-static.sh" shell wrapper
used during local tests with a static setup.

It provides a general overview of the syntax used by this
utility, then details how to get online help, how to run tests
with a given project and how to run them with a test
environment file.

For an introduction to static tests, see HOWTO-statictests.txt


Overview
--------

There are three ways to call basiliqa-static.sh:
 o with -h or --help parameter,
   it displays online help;
 o with a project name,
   it uses conventional paths for this project
   to locate the test environment file
 o with -e or --environment,
   it uses the provided test environment file.


First syntax: get help
----------------------

  -h
  --help

Displays an online help message.


Second syntax: project-based
----------------------------

All parameters but the project name are optional.


  -c <control-package>
  --control-pkg <control-package>

Specifies the name of the test control package.
If not provided, defaults to "tests-control".


  -j
  --jail

Instead of installing the control packages on the real
system, install them in a confinement jail in ~/jail.
This directory must have been prepared previously with
the script "init-jail.sh".


  -r <jail-root-directory>
  --jail-root <rpm-root-directory>

Instead of installing the control packages on the real
system, install them in a confinement jail given by
its path.
This directory must have been prepared previously with
the script "init-jail.sh".


  -w <workspace-directory>
  --workspace <workspace-directory>

Specifies the directory to use during the test to store
temporary files, results, etc. If not provided, defaults
to a directory named like the test project inside of the
"workspace root". The workspace root is normally
/var/tmp/basiliqa/workspace, but this can be redefined in
/etc/basiliqa/basiliqa.conf.


  <project-name>

Name of the source test package.


Third syntax: environment file based
------------------------------------

All parameters but the environment file path are optional.


  -c <control-package>
  --control-pkg <control-package>

Specifies the name of the test control package.
If not provided, defaults to "tests-control".


  -e <environment-file>
  --test-environment <environment-file>

Specifies the path to the test environment file. This
file describes the setup of the static test. It can be
located anywhere and is usually named "testenv.xml".
For details on its syntax, see REFERENCE-testenv.txt.


  -j
  --jail

Instead of installing the control packages on the real
system, install them in a confinement jail in ~/jail.
This directory must have been prepared previously with
the script "init-jail.sh".


  -r <jail-root-directory>
  --jail-root <rpm-root-directory>

Instead of installing the control packages on the real
system, install them in a confinement jail given by
its path.
This directory must have been prepared previously with
the script "init-jail.sh".


  -w <workspace-directory>
  --workspace <workspace-directory>

Specifies the directory to use during the test to store
temporary files, results, etc. If not provided, defaults
to a directory named like the test project inside of the
"workspace root". The workspace root is normally
/var/tmp/basiliqa/workspace, but this can be redefined in
/etc/basiliqa/basiliqa.conf.
