About this reference manual
---------------------------

This is the reference of the environment variables provided by
you, by Jenkins and by basiliQA to let the control scripts know
about their environment. The dedicated API to access
test environment (testenv) should be preferred.

It covers the variables passed by basiliQA, the variables
passed to basiliQA, and the variables passed by Jenkins.

For an introduction to test packages, see HOWTO-testpackage.txt.
For the API to access test environment, see REFERENCE-testenv.txt.


Variables passed by basiliQA
----------------------------

  $REPORT
  example value "/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/helloworld/junit-results.xml"

The name of the file holding the JUnit XML report. You do not need that
value if you use the jlogger helper function.


  $RUN_NAME
  example value "with_proxy"

The name of the current run. It is identical to the name in "run"
directive in the nodes file.


  $TARGET_<node>
  example name  $TARGET_SERVER
  example value "ssh:10.162.177.33"

A twopence "target" that can be used to communicate with test node.

SSH is used in most cases to communicate with the tests nodes, so
$TARGET_<node> is the same as ssh:$EXTERNAL_IP_<node>. In local
tests, you can use virtio-serial, in that case it is not
equivalent anymore, and the target starts with "virtio:".


  $EXTERNAL_IP_<node>
  example name  $EXTERNAL_IP_SERVER
  example value "10.162.177.33"

An IPv4 address for the node given by its capitalized name,
that can be reached from the outside of the test cloud. All the
network interfaces on the test nodes have at least an internal IP address.
If they are on a network that has an exit gateway, like the default
"fixed" network, they also get an external IP address. The external IP
address gets mapped (natted) to the internal IP address by the cloud.

In the OpenStack jargon, the internal IP is a "fixed IP" and the
external IP is a "floating IP".


  $INTERNAL_IP_<node>
  example name  $INTERNAL_IP_SERVER
  example value "192.168.1.4"

An IPv4 address for the node given by its capitalized name,
that is meaningful inside of the cloud. For the direct communication
between test nodes, it is advised to use internal IP addresses, even
though external ones should also work.


  $IP6_<node>

The IPv6 address for the node given by its capitalized name.
Numbering starts at 0. If there is no IPv6 address
associated to this network interface, this variable contains "N/A"

With IPv6, there is no difference between internal and external addresses.
If a gateway is available, all addresses have potential access to the outer
world.


  $INTERFACES_<node>
  example name  $INTERFACES_ROUTER
  example value "3"

The number of interfaces for the node given by its capitalized name.
Minimal value is 1, reflecting the fact that the fixed network is always
available.


  $EXTERNAL_IP_<node>_ETH<i>
  example name  $EXTERNAL_IP_SERVER_ETH2
  example value "10.162.177.35"

The external IPv4 address of the <i>th networking card of node given by
its capitalized name. Numbering starts at 0. If there is no external IP
associated to this network interface, this variable contains "N/A".


  $INTERNAL_IP_<node>_ETH<i>
  example name  $INTERNAL_IP_SERVER_ETH2
  example value "172.16.31.6"

The internal IPv4 address of the <i>th networking card of node given by
its capitalized name. Numbering starts at 0.

This is the IP address assigned by the cloud, but it does not necessarily
mean that, inside of the guest operating system, this card has been properly
set up with this address.

basiliQA removes the iptable rules established by OpenStack that would make
the use of that address mandatory. This allows for more flexibility in
testing. Still, it is adviced to use this address whenever possible.
If you can't, please use private networks, so to avoid address conflicts.


  $IP6_<node>_ETH<i>

The IPv6 address of the <i>th networking card of node given by
its capitalized name. Numbering starts at 0. If there is no IPv6 address
associated to this network interface, this variable contains "N/A"

With IPv6, there is no difference between internal and external addresses.
If a gateway is available, all addresses have potential access to the outer
world.

# FIXME: the version of OpenStack cloud that we use does not yet support
#        IPv6, so this setting and IPv6 in general can be used only
#        for local tests with QEmu/KVM.


  $NETWORK_<node>_ETH<i>
  example name  $NETWORK_SERVER_ETH2
  example value "private"

The name of the network to which the <i>th networking card of the node
given by its capitalized name is connected.


  $DISKS_<node>
  example name  $DISKS_NODE1
  example value "1"

The number of extra disks for the node given by its capitalized name.
Minimal value is 0, for no extra hard disk.


  $DISK_NAME_<node>_DISK<i>
  example name  $DISK_NAME_SUT_DISK0
  example value "/dev/vdb"

The device name of the <i>th hard disk of the node given by
its capitalized name.


  $DISK_SIZE_<node>_DISK<i>
  example name  $DISK_SIZE_SUT_DISK0
  example value "20G"

The size in gigabytes of the <i>th hard disk of the node given by
its capitalized name.


  $GATEWAY_IP_<network>
  example name  $GATEWAY_IP_PRIVATE
  example value "172.16.31.1"

IPv4 address for the exit gateway of a network given by its capitalized
name. IF there is no exit gateway for that network, this variable
contains "N/A".


  $SUBNET_IP_<network>
  example name  $SUBNET_IP_PRIVATE
  example value "172.16.31.0/24"

IPv4 subnet in CIDR notation for a network given by its capitalized name.
If there is no such subnet, this variable contains "N/A". The default
"fixed" network always has a subnet.


  $SUBNET6_IP_<network>
  example name  $SUBNET6_IP_PRIVATE
  example value "fd00:c0c0::/64"

IPv6 subnet in CIDR notation for a network given by its capitalized name.
If there is no such subnet, this variable contains "N/A".


Variables passed by basiliQA that can also be used in the nodes file
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Some variables created by basiliQA can be used both from your nodes file
and in your test suite. They are:

  $SYSTEM_<nodename>
  $FAMILY_<nodename>
  $ARCH_<nodename>
  $VARIANT_<nodename>
  $CHANNEL_<channel>_<nodename>

For more details about them, see REFERENCE-nodesfile.txt.


Variables passed to basiliQA
----------------------------

You can use in your tests all the variables that you passed to basiliQA:

  $PROJECT_NAME
  example value "helloworld"

The name of your test project.


  $CONTROL_PKG
  example value "tests-control"

The name of the control subpackage.


  $HOME_PROJECT
  example value "hmustermann"

(local tests only)
The name of a home project in IBS.


  $BUILD_ROOT
  example value "/var/tmp/build_root"

(local tests only)
The location of a local OBS build


  $EXECUTION_CONTEXT
  example value "with_nanny"

Different contexts allow to run same test suite several times in
parallel.


  $TEST_PARAMETERS
  example value "TEST_PRECISE,NANNY"

The behaviour of a test suite might depend on a series of
parameters stored in environment variables. A single "export"
of these variables is not enough, as they need to be passed
through the jail, if there is one.


  $IMAGE_SOURCE
  example value "http://basiliqa.suse.de/images/"
  usually taken from defaults

The location to pick the .qcow2 hard disk image from.


  $IMAGE_NAME_<node>
  example name  $IMAGE_NAME_SUT
  example value "SLE_12_SP1-x86_64-fips"

The image name of a test node, of the form '<system>-<arch>-<variant>'.
It matches the name of a file (with .qcow2 extension)
on the download server.


  $IMAGES_DIR
  example value "/var/tmp/basiliqa/images"

(local tests only)
The location of the .qcow2 images once downloaded.


  $JAIL_ROOT
  example value "/var/lib/jenkins/jail"
  usually taken from defaults

Lets rpm and zypper use a confined jail. Use the path to the root of
that jail, or "none" if you want to use the normal root "/".
If you use the normal root, you need to allow rpm and zypper to be run
with root priviledges by modifying /etc/sudoers.


  $SUBNET_FIXED
  example value "10.1.0.0/16"

(local tests only)
The IPv4 range to use for the fixed network.
Defaults to "192.168.15.0/24".


  $SUBNET6_FIXED
  example value "fd00:1:2:3::/64"

(local tests only)
The IPv6 range to use for the fixed network.
Defaults to "fc00:0:0:f::/64".


  $REMOTE_VIRT_HOST
  example value "1.2.3.4"
  usually taken from defaults

(local tests only)
The IP address of the server running libvirtd. Default is it
to be undefined.


  $REMOTE_VIRT_USER
  example value "basiliqa"
  usually taken from defaults

(local tests only)
A user name on the server running libvirtd. Default is it
to be undefined.


  $REMOTE_DHCP_HOST
  example value "1.2.3.4"
  usually taken from defaults

(local tests only)
The IP address of the DHCP server of an external "fixed" network.
Default is it to be undefined.


  $REMOTE_DHCP_USER
  example value "basiliqa"
  usually taken from defaults

(local tests only)
A user name on the DHCP server of an external "fixed" network.
Default is it to be undefined.


  $TARGET_TYPE
  example value "virtio"
  usually taken from defaults

(local tests only)
The way to communicate between control node and SUTs. Default is "ssh".


  $WORKSPACE_ROOT
  example value /var/lib/jenkins/workspace
  usually taken from defaults

Each project uses a subdirectory of this directory to drop the files needed
for testing. Usually, you don't change this when testing from the cloud.


  $WORKSPACE
  example value "/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/suite-helloworld"

(local tests only)
The absolute path of the workspace. Feel free to drop any file into
that directory during your test.


Variables passed by Jenkins
---------------------------

The variables passed by Jenkins can be used from your tests.
However, please notice they will not be defined if you do
not test in the cloud, for example if you test locally with VMs.

*** TODO: we might emulate them during local tests if needed ***
