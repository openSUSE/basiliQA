What is basiliQA?
=================

basiliQA is a component testing framework. It lets individual software
components be tested in the cloud, in local VMs, or on test lab machines.
It enables multi-node testing, private networks, and disks on demand.

basiliQA is open source software under GNU General Public License version 2.0.

This is the __basiliQA-engine__ package. It is the part needed to prepare
the testing environment, and to run the testsuites. The software to assist
the test suites during their execution is packaged separately.

For further documentation, please refer to the basiliQA package.
